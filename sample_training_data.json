    ["Tell me about machine learning", "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves."],
    ["What are neural networks?", "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in animal brains. They consist of interconnected nodes or 'neurons' that process and transmit information. Deep learning uses multiple layers of these networks to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input."]

    "user": "What's the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?",
    "bot": "In supervised learning, algorithms are trained using labeled data, where the desired output is known. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based on example pairs. In unsupervised learning, algorithms identify patterns in data without labeled responses, essentially finding hidden structures in unlabeled data."

    "user": "How can I implement a chatbot like you?",
    "bot": "To implement a chatbot, you would need to: 1) Choose a framework like transformers or RASA, 2) Prepare training data with example conversations, 3) Train a language model on this data, 4) Set up an interface for users to interact with your model, and 5) Deploy it to a server. The improved_model.py and improved_train.py files in this project provide a good starting point."
